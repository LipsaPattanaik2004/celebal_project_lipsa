# 📊 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction

This project predicts the **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** using transaction data from an online retail dataset. The goal is to identify high-value customers based on **purchase behavior**, **frequency**, and **monetary contribution**.

## 📌 Objectives

- Preprocess and clean transactional data  
- Generate **RFM features** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)  
- Apply **BG/NBD** and **Gamma-Gamma** models to predict:
  - Future purchases  
  - Expected monetary value  
  - 6-month CLV  
- Segment customers using **K-Means clustering**  
- Visualize customer distribution and gain insights for targeting

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**
- `lifetimes` (for probabilistic CLV modeling)
- `scikit-learn` (for clustering algorithms)
- `XGBoost` *(optional for classification tasks)*

---

## 📈 Results

- Customers are segmented by predicted CLV
- Visualizations reveal differences in value-based customer groups
- Business can focus on top segments for **retention** and **upselling**
